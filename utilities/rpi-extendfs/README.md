rpi-extendfs
============

Menu-driven dialog using utility for extending size of root filesystem.
Similar to raspi-config from other distributions, but at the moment does
nothing more than resizing of root filesystem. Original project name was
rpi-config, which was supposed to be port of raspi-config for OpenWrt,
but as I was too busy to do something else, for the moment, only root
fs extending is supported. Possibly more features in future.
